xomxplayer
==========

This is a simple mapping of omxplayer's (https://github.com/popcornmix/omxplayer/) window to an x-window for easy resize and movement using the mouse. It is not a stand alone player - omxplayer binary is required!

This version has been tested on a raspberry PI 3 running Arch Linux using a recent version of dwm (http://suckless.org/) and the default archlinux arm (https://archlinuxarm.org/) package for omxplayer.

See code for configuration and compile instructions.

Why?
====

I wanted to be able to move and resize omxplayer's window using the mouse. Although there is other software around which achieves this, it seemed overly complex to me - I only required a simple mapping of keyboard commands and window resize / move functions.
